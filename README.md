### Task 1
##### Part a
It was quite interesting to learn about some applications of linear algebra in computer vision. I tried to create a spiral path of an object.

##### Part b
The open3d library was quite new to me so I took some time to learn about the functionalities. Overall, I used information that was provided to me to create a simple wireframe of the camera (looks exactly like the one in the video) and then created a simple animation of it rotating about its endpoint. I did not have time to explore more on the animation and open3d as these 2 weeks are my exam weeks (mid term). Nonetheless, It is always interesting to learn about new tools and technology.
